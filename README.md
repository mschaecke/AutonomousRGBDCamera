# AutonomousRGBDCamera

An autonomous RGB-D camera which creates and modifies environments in Unreal Engine. Both RGB-D and annotation data are captured and published via TCP. An [Unreal Engine to ROS bridge](https://github.com/mschaecke/Bridge-For-AutonomousRGBDCamera) is available.

A thesis elaborating the project can be requested at the [Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science](https://www.uni-bremen.de/en/open-campus/program/tents/faculty-3-mathematics-and-computer-science) at the [University of Bremen](https://www.uni-bremen.de/en/). It includes the theoretical background, architecture and evaluation.

# Demonstration

# Usage

* Ensure the correct Unreal Engine version (4.22.3) is used. Other versions might work properly but were not tested.
